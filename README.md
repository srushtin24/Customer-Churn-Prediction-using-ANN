# Customer Churn Prediction Using ANN (Artificial Neural Network) 
This repository contains two complete models for predicting customer churn using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) built with TensorFlow/Keras. The objective is to analyze telecom customer behavior and predict whether a customer will churn or stay.
What makes this project strong is that it includes both a baseline ANN model and an enhanced version with imbalanced data handling (SMOTE).<br>
